# CSE Project D (30)

## abstract (theme)
A 2d "Enter the Gungeon" inspired video game with a heavier emphasis on story.


## client
- Maverick
    - artwork, story and setting



## language and libraries 
- python
    - simplicity and readability of syntax
- pygame
    - gui will allow for external artwork, including sprites, music, etc

## environment (ide)
- vs code
    - plugin integrations for vim and git
    - locally ran; better performance
    - my personal choice

## skills
- classes and objects
    - This project will need to be object oriented, due to the complex nature of a game like this, with lots of moving elements
- files
    - The option to save the game state, or load the save state from a file will be provided. This will require a system that allows class objects and their properties to be written to a file, as well as allowing class objects to be initialized from a file.

- gui
    - necissary for the game to run, provided by pygame
