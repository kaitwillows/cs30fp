- classes and objects
    - This project will need to be object oriented, due to the complex nature of a game like this, with lots of moving elements
- files
    - The option to save the game state, or load the save state from a file will be provided. This will require a system that allows class objects and their properties to be written to a file, as well as allowing class objects to be initialized from a file.
