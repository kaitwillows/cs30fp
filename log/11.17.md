for my final project, i'm gonna be creating a game inspired by the mechanics and gameplay of "enter the gungeon."  

"enter the gungeon" is a 2d rouglike game where you try to make your way through a dungeon while being bombarded with enemies that don't want you to do that

what stood out to me about this game was the controls,  
which are simple, but very well designed.  

on pc, you move around with the arrow keys, and to shoot something, you point and click, with your mouse becoming the crosshair  
but as you move your crosshair, the camera shifts to frame more of what you're aiming at, making the gameplay feel very fluid and streamlined  

the audio and visual aesthetics as well have purposeful design, and make the game feel very polished.

my client will be my friend, Maverick
we were talking the other day about how generic many fantacy or sci-fi words are, especially when it comes to cold planets or environments and how they always repeat the same boring tropes.  
he said that he wanted to create a story in an environment like that, but that wasn't just a setting of "cold desolate blizzard planet with nothing and nobody there."  

the idea piqued my interest and i also needed a client for this project so i asked "hey, do you want to make that into a game?"  
and he said "yes"

the game will draw the aforementioned elements from "enter the gungeon,"  
but place a higher emphasis on storytelling and sort of exploration,  
(i don't know how fleshed out everything will be goven the timeframe i have.)

maverick will be working mostly on the story, and visual art, 
while i'll be working on the game's code, sound design and *probably* music,  
if not, i'll "borrow" some other songs that will fit the game.
