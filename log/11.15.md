# 11/15

## proposal
this final project will be a video game with similar controls and gameplay to "enter the gungeon."  

- language in python with the pygame library. 
    - easier and more straightforward syntax will help with code comprehensiveness and cleanliness.
    - pygame's simplicity will allow [idk]
- environment will be vs code and git/github because it's cool

advanced skills 
- file handling - for the games save file, and settings/preferences if any
- gui - for the game itself.
- objects/classes
    - the player, properties about them including health
    
- data structures??


## today
i'm just planning on getting used to the syntax of python and pygame. i'll try to create a simple game or prototype as a proof of concept

i mostly just copied from the pygame docs

## reasources
[pygame docs](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)

## tomorrow
i'd like to get a pixelated sprite (character) moving on screen, and a crosshair tracked by the mouse on screen

(i mean i should probably get on the proposal for this project)

later i'd like to get a map imported that gives the character an environment with collision and bounds, and a paralax effect that changes the "camera" perspective with mouse movement, as seen in "enter the gungeon"
