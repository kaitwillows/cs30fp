## proposal
this final project will be a video game with similar controls and gameplay to "enter the gungeon."  

- language in python with the pygame library. 
    - easier and more straightforward syntax will help with code comprehensiveness and cleanliness.
    - pygame's simplicity will allow [idk]
- environment will be vs code and git/github because it's cool

## today
i'm just planning on getting used to the syntax of python and pygame. i'll try to create a simple game or prototype as a proof of concept
