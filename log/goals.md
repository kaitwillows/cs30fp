these are mostly for just design and whatnot

- snowy setting, mostly white, with mountain edges as map walls

- black and white colour pallet

- main enemy is just a black dot that warps space like a black hole. warping the screen as a whole, also can be made to be the cursor in the menu idk


- side quest(s)
    - gonna be a bunny in a cabin somewhere with a dead wife and he's agoraphobic but rlly smart so then he learns to synthazise food and create colour. the quest is that you have to find some keepsake or something that his wife wanted to be buried with, his wife had this close friend that the bun himself rarely or never talked to, but he would know more about the keepsake
