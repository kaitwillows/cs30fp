so as you can tell, this currently is not finished

and yes, i probably should used unity, however, unity did not want to work with me, and as such, i am stuck here, with a library i uncertainly label a game engine. i build the camera, movement, collision and rendering from scratch, and all for what, a game i may never complete? a project that may never live up to my expectations?

only in time, only in time. for this is 20 days
