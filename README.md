## big ideas  
video game
- pixel art??
- multi window thing??????
    - could it change focus on its own
i really wanna make just a survival game like imagine ark but like with b- graphics

- intro sequence i want to have a small window (menu screen) with an option to start.
- upon starting, the program will do cool things with the windows like create a bunch of them
there could also be windows within a fullscreen one, but reusing the given functionality could make it easier to give the user control??
